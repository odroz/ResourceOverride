# The Future of Resource Override

My top priority for Resource Override has always been to provide an ad-free, open source, useful tool that costs nothing to the end user.

I plan to keep it this way.

Resource Override has unofficially been in maintenance mode for a while now. I have realized that my free time has become quite limited, so from this point forward, Resource Override is now officially in maintenance mode.

What this means:

* I will continue to fix any critical bugs that cause basic functionality to break.

* No new features will be added and any features that were never working in the first place (if any) wont be fixed.

* It's unlikely I will be accepting pull requests because I simply don't have the time to test and make sure everything works. I really don't want to introduce any bugs. Changing code for features is too risky for me at this point.

* It's unlikely I will be able to support my user base at this time, but if you have a simple question about Resource Override, I can try my best to answer. Feel free to email me at `kyle.a.paulsen(at)gmail.com`

Again, it is important to me that you have an ad-free, free, open source option for this kind of tool. If you are still using Resource Override, thanks for trying it out and I'm glad it may have helped you.
